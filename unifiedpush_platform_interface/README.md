# UnifiedPush flutter-connector platform interface

UnifiedPush is specifications and tools that let the user choose how push notifications are delivered. All in a free and open source way.

This is the platform interface used in the [unifiedpush](../unifiedpush) package. It allows implementations for new platforms using Flutter federated plugins.

Developers simply wanting to use UnifiedPush in their Flutter apps probably don't need to look here and should check out the [UnifiedPush plugin](../unifiedpush) instead.
